			<h2> Interests </h2>
				<p>
				When I am not in school or working, I try my best to enjoy the outdoors. This includes
				going on picnics, hiking, and jogging. Reading has also become one of my favorite hobbies. I mostly
				enjoy fiction but I am willing to read anything from Autobiographies to Sci-Fi novels and anything in between.
